In the CNF,
we chose to test the most significant sum bit (S31) beacuse in the case of the Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), the carry-in  
for the S31 bit (COut30) depends on all the previous carries (COut29 to  Cin).
In the case of the Carry Lookahead adder, the carry-in for every bit goes through 5 layers, therefore the logic for any carry 
in CLA is similar.
Hnece, testing the S31 bit for both adders allows us to consider the term with the most number of computations in each
case, thereby strongly proving the logic of our optimised Carry Look Ahead Adder.
